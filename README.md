# patrikRenameLibrary
 Rename a list of files after a similar list of files
 
 Main problem was that I had two files in separate folders: "track01.wav" & "01 Auto, Oldsmobile Cutlass Ext, Start, Idle, Shut Off From Side.mp3"
 
 I only want the .wav file for quality reasons, but I need the longer filename so that I can find it in my library when searching.
 
 Instead of manually copying and pasting filenames for <3000 files i made this.
